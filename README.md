# React + Vite

App Name: ToDo App

Description:
React is a JavaScript library for building web app user interfaces. While working within a React project, we have to select a build tool and server, such as Vite. Vite is a quick and easy build tool for frontend development that includes near-instant server startup.

Installation Instructions/Run Developer Server:

1. Create a new public repo on GitHub
   give it the name "todo-list"
   clone the repo to your local environment (this differs based on if you're using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub Desktop. See GitHub's documentation on remote repos for more details.)
2. Scaffold Vite Using CLI
   Bootstrap a new project with command: npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
   Install with command: npm install
3. Commit and push in the terminal to github.
4. Start the development server with the command: npm run dev. Open a browser to the Local link listed in the CLI
5. Clean up App's code:
   -Remove imports and add what is needed.
   -Create an array of objects to represent your todo-lists.
6. Commit changes to your local working branch.
   -Push the changes up to GitHub and publish if have not.
   -In GitHub, create a pull request that compares the working branch to main.
   - Copy the pull request link and submit assignment.
